# Parallel-Merge-sort
This is a java code which uses multi threading to perform parallel execution of merge sort. Here only 2 threads have been used whereas it would be much effective in performance. here the arrays have been seperated into 2 parts and each parts have been assigned to each threads. so both executions will be done parallely and finally they will be get merged.
